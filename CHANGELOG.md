## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Initial project setup with Soroban smart contracts
- Decentralized crowdfunding platform on Stellar network
- Pull-based refund model for scalable fund distribution
- Platform fee configuration support
- Next.js frontend with Freighter wallet integration
- Campaign registry contract for discovery
- Comprehensive test suite with snapshots
- CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
- `DataKey::ContributorIndex(u32)` storage key for O(1) per-contributor writes,
  replacing the O(n) `KEY_CONTRIBS` Vec append that grew proportionally with
  campaign size.
- `estimateContributionGas(contractId, contributor, amount, tokenId)` in
  `apps/interface/src/lib/contract.ts` — simulates a contribution and returns
  the estimated network fee in stroops and XLM before the user signs.
- `getContributorsPaginated(contractId, offset, limit)` in
  `apps/interface/src/lib/contract.ts` — fetches a page of contributor addresses
  using the new indexed storage, proportional only to page size.
- `validate_refund_eligibility(now, deadline, total, goal)` in `validation.rs`
  combines the duplicate deadline + goal checks shared by `refund_single` and
  `refund_batch` into a single short-circuit function.
- Extended benchmark suite in `contract_benchmarks.rs`: `contribute_repeat_contributor`,
  `contribute_50th_contributor`, `get_stats_empty`, `get_stats_10_contributors`,
  `contributor_list_page1_of_10`, and `contributor_list_page2_of_50`.

### Changed
- `contribute()` now validates the minimum-amount constraint **before** reading
  the blacklist/whitelist from persistent storage, saving 1–2 storage reads on
  every rejected under-minimum contribution.
- `contributor_list(offset, limit)` now reads only the requested page of
  contributors via indexed persistent keys instead of deserialising the full
  contributor list on every call.
- `get_stats()` now caches the instance storage handle to reduce repeated borrow
  overhead across the four instance reads it performs.
- `get_performance_metrics()` now correctly reads contributors from persistent
  storage via indexed keys; previously it read `KEY_CONTRIBS` from instance
  storage (which was always empty), so trending was always 0.
- `refund_single()` and `refund_batch()` now delegate their eligibility checks
  to `validate_refund_eligibility()`, removing duplicated inline logic.
- `contribute_on_behalf()` now also writes `DataKey::ContributorIndex` for
  first-time delegated contributors, making them visible via `contributor_list`.

### Deprecated

### Removed

### Fixed
- `get_performance_metrics()` trending metric was always 0 because contributors
  were read from the wrong storage tier (instance instead of persistent).
